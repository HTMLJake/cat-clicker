## About

This project is for the Udacity front-end Nanodegree. It is to show how to create an app using a model-view-octopus (MVO). The app seperates the data from the view using the octopus to create more organized code.

The idea behind the project is you have a list of cats that you can select and then you click on the cat image to increase the amount of clicks on the cat. You can also edit cats or even add cats to your session. 

> Note: if you refresh your session, any changes or added cats will not be saved. In order to make any changes permanent you will have to edit the `model.catArr` object in the `js/app.js` file. 

## Installation

To run this code run `clone` the project and open `index.html` in any modern browser or head over to [jperrydev.com/cat-clicker](http://jperrydev.com/cat-clicker/) to try it out.
